# Squerall Usage Screencase

In order to reduce the download size of Squerall Git repository, screencase videos have been shared on YouTube. Find them [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPK2FhYhh-g2f6O6oxs8SOeWg82ODFuoq). 

The reference from papers remain the same, <https://git.io/fjyOO> redirecting to <https://github.com/EIS-Bonn/Squerall/tree/master/evaluation/screencasts>, i.e., this page.
